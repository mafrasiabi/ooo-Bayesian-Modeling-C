## Background Study
### > Gaussian Distribution


### > Dirichlet Distribution
It's a distribution on a probability distribution. It's a distribution over `n` dimensional vectors.

## 1. Gaussian Process
For any set `S`, **GP on `S`** refers to a bunch of random variables whose index is the member of the set `S` such that they can have the following properties: The bunch of variables are normally multivariate distributed!
