Non-parametric Bayesian Model

## Background Study
### > Gaussian Distribution


### > Dirichlet Distribution
It's a distribution on a probability distribution. It's a distribution over `n` dimensional vectors called "θ". It can be thought of as a multivariate beta distribution for a collection of probabilities (that must sum to 1). 
 - Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior for the **multinomial likelihood**.
 - Each `θ_i` has its own `α`...weight for each distribution of `θ_i`
 - Each `θ_i` has its own distribution.
 - Total sum of `θ_i` is 1.

## 1. Gaussian Process
For any set `S`, **GP on `S`** refers to a bunch of random variables whose index is the member of the set `S` such that they can have the following properties: The bunch of variables are normally multivariate distributed!
